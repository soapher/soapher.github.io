			<h1>Soph's little art corner</h1>
			<p>Hey there! Welcome to my website. It's still quite jank but that's okay, I'll fix it up in the future. (hopefully</p>
			<p>The point of this website is to be a sort of a "portfolio" for my art and other goodies that I make. It started out as an inside joke (hence the name leon archive dot org) but I figured I'd give some purpose to it.</p>
			<p>That being said, feel free to look at some of my artwork, or download some goodies using the links below :D</p>
